Lab 3 file structure
Hello! This is my web map for the first part of Lab 3. This is the Read Me file. Enjoy the lab, and please reach out if you have any questions. For the most part, part 1 was fairly straughtforward. However, the most challenging part of the lab was getting the file structure to work correctly. Having the right file structure (in the beginning instructions that start this lab) is super important to making sure that the maps load correctly and that additional data is added to the basemap of Asheville. Overall good lab, and it went fairly smoothly. Enjoy!
